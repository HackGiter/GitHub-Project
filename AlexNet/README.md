# AlexNet

If you want more details about the alexnet, please read the essay.

Actually, this model didn't work well as I expected. Maybe because I didn't modify the data correctly or just choose hyper parameters well. And some essays said the Local Response Normalization don't work well in a lot of tasks, so I'm not sure.

If you improve the performance of this model , please give a comment, I do like to more details.
